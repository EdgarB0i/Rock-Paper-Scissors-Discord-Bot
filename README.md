This is the full code to my very own "RPS Gamer" discord bot.
It has been made with discord.py and has been hosted up on Replit.
Due to the usage of Replit's environment(for token) and hosting, there are some additional codes and files up on Replit.
The bot can do the following commands: !hello, !help, !RPS @user
This bot's main functionality is the !RPS @user command. A person can initiate a game of Rock,Paper and Scissors against any other server member. The bot itself will dm both participants where the users can input their moves. Finally the bot returns the results with some images in the channel where the command was called.
